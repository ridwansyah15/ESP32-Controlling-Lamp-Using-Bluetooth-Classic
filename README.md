# ESP32-Controlling-Lamp-Using-Bluetooth-Classic
In this project, I am using NodeMCU ESP-32 to control lamp via bluetooth classic. In this case, I am using serial communication from my phone/PC as a client to ESP-32 as a server.

Here are a few things that you have to prepare for this project:
* NodeMCU ESP-32/32S
* Relay module (Active Low)
* DC adapter
* Serial Bluetooth Terminal
  * [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal&hl=en&gl=US)
  * [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/bluetooth-serial-terminal/9wzdncrdfst8?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

Copy and paste this link to your Arduino IDE preference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

Go to the boards manager, search and download **esp32 by Espressif Systems**

Then you ready to make your own simple home automation!
