# ESP32-Controlling-Lamp-Using-Bluetooth-Classic
In this project, I am using NodeMCU ESP-32 to control lamp via bluetooth classic. In this case, I'm using serial communication from my phone/PC as a client to ESP-32 as a server.

Here are a few things that you have to prepare for this project:
* NodeMCU ESP-32/32S
* Relay module (Active Low)
* DC adapter
* Serial Bluetooth Terminal (Android) / (Windows)
